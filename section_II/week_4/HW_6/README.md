# Program 1: Total Revenue Calculation

This program reads an input file, `inputfile.txt`, containing cashier names and corresponding invoices. It calculates the total revenue generated by each cashier by summing the invoice values. The program then creates a separate file for each cashier, named `firstname_lastname_rank.txt`, and writes the cashier's full name and their total revenue to the file.

## Instructions

1. Ensure that the input file, `inputfile.txt`, is in the same directory as the program.
2. Run the program.
3. The program will generate separate output files for each cashier, containing their full name and total revenue.
