# Week 1 Tasks

This repository contains solutions for the homeworks assigned in Week 1 of the ITBootcamp course. The tasks include:

1. Tautology Checker: A Python program that determines whether a given set of logical formulas are tautologies. It uses Python logical operators to evaluate the formulas and prints the results to the standard output.

2. Digit Counter: A Python program that counts the number of even and odd digits in a given number. The program takes input from the user, iterates through the digits, and keeps track of the count of even and odd digits. It then determines and prints whether there are more even digits, more odd digits, or an equal number of even and odd digits.

3. Pizza Bill Calculator: A Python program that calculates and prints the bill at a pizzeria. It considers the size of the pizza (S, M, or L), adds the pizza cost based on the size, includes a delivery fee, and applies additional charges for bad weather conditions. The program also reduces the delivery fee by 20% if the total bill amount exceeds 800 RSD.



## Getting Started

To run the programs, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Simply execute the Python files using a Python interpreter or run them in an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Python.

## Usage

1. Tautology Checker:
   - Execute the `HW_1.py`, `HW_2.py`, `HW_3.py`, `HW_4.py` files.
   - Follow the prompts to enter the logical formulas you want to check.
   - The program will evaluate the formulas and display the results on the standard output.

2. Digit Counter:
   - Execute the `HW_2_1.py` file.
   - Enter a number when prompted.
   - The program will count the number of even and odd digits in the given number.
   - It will then determine and print whether there are more even digits, more odd digits, or an equal number of even and odd digits.

3. Pizza Bill Calculator:
   - Execute the `HW_2_2.py` file.
   - Enter the pizza size (S/M/L) when prompted.
   - Follow the instructions to place additional orders or terminate the program.
   - The program will calculate the bill considering the pizza size, delivery fee, and any additional charges for bad weather conditions.
   - The final bill amount will be displayed on the standard output.
