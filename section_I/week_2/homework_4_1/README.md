# Homework 4_1 

This repository contains several Python programs that demonstrate different functionalities. Below, you'll find a brief description of each program along with instructions on how to run them.

## 1. Generating Sublists

File: `HW_4_1.py`

Description: This program defines a function that generates sublists from a given list. It takes a list as input and generates all possible sublists, including empty sublists and sublists with different combinations of elements.

Usage: Run the program and provide a list as input. The program will print all the generated sublists.

## 2. List Intersection and Difference

File: `HW_4_2.py`

Description: This program defines functions for finding the intersection and difference between two lists. The intersection function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the common elements. The difference function takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are in the first list but not in the second.

Usage: Run the program and provide two lists as input. The program will print the resulting list for each operation.

## 3. Finding Unique Values in List of Tuples

File: `HW_4_3.py`

Description: This program defines a function that finds unique values in a given list of tuples. It iterates through the tuples and identifies the unique values, then prints them to the standard output.

Usage: Run the program. The unique values will be displayed on the standard output.

## 4. Sorting Elements from Two Lists

File: `HW_4_4.py`

Description: This program defines a function that takes two lists as input and creates a new list containing even elements from the first list and odd elements from the second list. The resulting list is sorted in descending order.

Usage: Run the program and provide two lists as input. The program will print the sorted list.

## 5. Checking Type Consistency in a List

File: `HW_4_5.py`

Description: This program defines a function that checks whether all elements in a list are of the same type. It iterates through the list and compares the types of each element. If all elements have the same type, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Usage: Run the program and provide a list as input. The program will print the result indicating whether the elements have consistent types or not.

Feel free to explore and run these programs to see their functionalities in action!
