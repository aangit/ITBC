Output: {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}

### Character Frequency Analyzer

The Character Frequency Analyzer program analyzes a given text and determines the percentage frequency of each unique character in the text. It calculates the occurrence percentage for characters with grades ranging from 6 to 10.

Example:
Input: "say hello to my little friend"
Output: {"a": 3.45, "d": 3.45, "e": 10.35, "f": 3.45, "h": 3.45, "i": 6.9, "l": 13.8, ..., " ": 17.24}

### Student Performance Tracker

The Student Performance Tracker program enables tracking and management of student performance in exams. It allows storing student information such as name, surname, student ID, program code, and the courses they need to pass or have passed with grades from 6 to 10. The program provides various functionalities to analyze student performance and generate reports.

Features:
